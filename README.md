# Intelligent CI/CD Pipeline Assistant — Complete Project

Purpose: A runnable prototype that receives CI webhooks (Jenkins / GitHub Actions), extracts and summarizes failing logs, queries an LLM (OpenAI) for diagnosis and fixes, auto-generates pipeline config suggestions, creates a PR with the patch, and notifies engineers.

See .env.example for required environment variables.
